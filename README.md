Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client we designed for DriverPass a company designed to provide users with a platform to learn state driving laws as well as get hands-on driving instruction from in-person driving tests. The users also have access to the latest state driving laws as well as access to practice written tests.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel for this project I understood how to gather requirements and how to assess just what the client is asking for when designing their system. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I feel that I could have gone more in-depth on the Gantt chart as well as my activity chart and UML diagrams.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I first looked at what the client was trying to accomplish with their design then implemented those by first looking at how the app should start and flow from one activity to the next. We needed to make sure the user was able to access all the latest driving laws and training whether for written practice tests or in-person driving tests, scheduled with a driving instructor of the client's choosing. The design also needed to implement a connection to the cloud to safely store all of the user's information such as name, date of birth, as well as payment information for the purpose of buying different packages based on the client's needs. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing a system because of who uses the system hence it needs to be designed so that the user enjoys using it, if the system is hard to use or understand the users won't use it and then the system goes "dead".

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by first looking at and really understanding exactly what the client is looking for from their app or site, then I decide what is the best way to implement what they are looking for that will also give the best flow to the project. I feel that my future approach will be much the same only more refined as I gain more knowledge in this subject.
